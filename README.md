# CF example app: ping-pong matching server

This is an app to match ping-pong players with each other. It's currently an
API only, so you have to use `curl` to interact with it.

It has an [acceptance test suite][acceptance-test] you might like to look at.

## Running on [Pivotal Web Services][pws]

Log in.

```bash
cf login -a https://api.run.pivotal.io
```

Target your org / space.

```bash
cf target -o polinchw -s development
```

Sign up for a cleardb instance.

```bash
cf create-service cleardb spark mysql
```

Build the app.

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Push the app. Its manifest assumes you called your ClearDB instance 'mysql'.

```bash
cf push pong_matcher_spring -n pong-match-spring-polinchw
```

Export the test host

```bash
export HOST=http://pong-match-spring-polinchw.cfapps.io
```

Now follow the [interaction instructions][interaction].

## Running locally

The following assumes you have a working Java 1.8 SDK installed.

Install and start mysql:

```bash
brew install mysql
mysql.server start
mysql -u root
```

Create a database user and table in the MySQL REPL you just opened:

```sql
CREATE USER 'springpong'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'springpong';
CREATE DATABASE pong_matcher_spring_development;
GRANT ALL ON pong_matcher_spring_development.* TO 'springpong'@'localhost';
exit
```

Start the application server from your IDE or the command line:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Export the test host

```bash
export HOST=http://localhost:8080
```

Now follow the [interaction instructions][interaction].
